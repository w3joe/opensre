# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Tracer.

This document describes how to propose changes, report bugs, and submit pull requests in a way that keeps review fast and the project reliable.

## Quick links

- Docs: https://www.tracer.cloud/docs
- Support / contact: hello@tracer.cloud
- Book a demo: https://www.tracer.cloud/demo
- Trust Center: https://trust.tracer.cloud/

## Choose the right channel

- **Bugs & small fixes**: open a GitHub Issue (if one exists) and/or submit a PR.
- **New features / behavioral changes**: open a GitHub Issue first to discuss the approach.
- **Questions / “how do I”**: use the docs or email hello@tracer.cloud (GitHub Issues are for actionable engineering work).
- **Security issues**: do **not** open a public issue; follow `SECURITY.md`.

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Add or update tests (where applicable)
4. Run the project’s checks locally before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   make lint        # ruff linter
   make typecheck   # mypy
   make test-cov    # pytest with coverage
   ```
   All three must pass. CI runs the same checks and a PR cannot be merged if they fail.
5. Open a pull request

## Windows Setup

Windows does not include `make` by default. We use `make` as a task runner for commands like linting, type-checking, and testing, so you’ll need to install it first.

**Step 1 — Open PowerShell as Administrator** (search "PowerShell" in Start Menu → right-click → "Run as administrator")

### Option 1 — Chocolatey

**Step 2 — Install Chocolatey** (paste this and press Enter):

⚠️ This command executes a remote script from Chocolatey. Review it before running.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

**Step 3 — Install make:**

```powershell
choco install make
```

### Option 2 — winget

Install `make` with `winget`:

```powershell
winget install GnuWin32.Make
```

**Step 4 — Restart your terminal** to ensure `make` is available in your `PATH`.

**Step 5 — Verify the installation:**

```bash
make --version
```

You can now run the standard checks:

```bash
make lint
make typecheck
make test-cov
```

### Pull request guidelines

To keep PRs easy to review:

- Keep PRs **focused** (one logical change per PR)
- Describe **what** changed and **why**
- Include relevant context (links to issues, logs, screenshots)
- Avoid drive-by refactors mixed with functional changes

If your PR changes user-visible behavior or output, include:

- **Before** and **after** evidence (screenshots, logs, CLI output, etc.)

## Code quality expectations

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Add tests for bug fixes and non-trivial logic
- Keep public APIs stable; call out breaking changes explicitly
- Update documentation when behavior or configuration changes

## AI-assisted contributions

AI-assisted PRs are welcome.

If you used an AI tool to generate any portion of the change, please include:

- A note in the PR description that it is **AI-assisted**
- The level of testing performed (untested / lightly tested / fully tested)
- Anything a reviewer should double-check (assumptions, edge cases)

## Reporting bugs

When filing a bug, include:

- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (minimal repro if possible)
- Environment details (OS, version, relevant config)
- Logs or error output (redact secrets)
